NMC B
	Overlap			75
	Single file		25
	1000 lines each		50
	1000 lines from input	25

NMC B: Training and testing data overlap (the lines that go into the testing file shouldn't go into the training file)
75, 85

NMC B: You only write a single file as output, instead of a training and a testing file
25, 56

NMC B: You only wrote 1000 lines in your training file, while it should use all lines that don't go into the testing file (23200 lines total)
50, 71

NMC B: You take the 1000 lines from the input, instead of processing the data first. This leads to a very small training set. 
25, 56

NMC A: You used both the update and forget gate, but you were supposed to only use the update gate (only z, no r).

Language Models A: Adding the -1 should have been it's own step, as every mathemathical operation is supposed to get its own node.

Language Models A: Node D should have been split up, as every mathemathical operation is supposed to get its own node.
